# lspwatch

`lspwatch` is a configurable stdin/stdout proxy for the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). It produces and exports telemetry for the language server and LSP request/response communication.

`lspwatch` can calculate and export:

* **Request duration**: how long it takes for the language server to respond to code completion, hover, go-to-definition, etc requests from the editor.

    * Metric name: `lspwatch.request.duration`. Tagged with `method`--the LSP method name (e.g `textDocument/completion`).

* **Language server resident-set size (RSS)**: how much memory the language server is actively using.

    * Metric name: `lspwatch.server.rss`.

* **Number of language server crashes**.

    * Metric name: `lspwatch.server.crashes`.

Users can optionally choose to tag metrics with:

* `language_server`: name of language server binary (e.g `clangd`).
* `user`: username on the machine.
* `os`: operating system.
* `ram`: total amount of RAM on the machine.

## Usage

`lspwatch` is an executable that stands in place of the language server. If your language server is invoked using e.g `clangd ...`, then you can run `lspwatch -- clangd ...`.

Every editor that supports LSP will have a way to configure the  command used to invoke the language server. Reference the documenation of your editor or language extension for details.

## Configuration

`lspwatch` can be configured with a YAML file. Use the `--config` or `-c` flag to specify the path.
